## ✅ Create Actionable Alerts in Splunk

### 🎯 Objective:
Detect specific security conditions in your AWS environment and trigger alerts in Splunk that a SOC (or you — the boss 😎) can act on.

### 🚨 EC2 Activity Detected Alert

**Description:**  
Detects when an EC2 instance is launched (`RunInstances`) or terminated (`TerminateInstances`) in AWS. Useful for identifying unauthorized provisioning or unexpected deletions.

---

### 🔍 SPL Query:

```spl
index=cloudtrail sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail eventSource="ec2.amazonaws.com"
(eventName="RunInstances" OR eventName="TerminateInstances")
| stats count by _time, eventName, userIdentity.arn, sourceIPAddress, requestParameters.instancesSet.items{}.instanceId



 ##  Steps to Create the Alert:
Run the SPL above in Splunk Search

Click Save As > Alert

Configure the alert settings:

Title: EC2 Creation or Deletion Detected

Trigger Condition: Number of Results > 0

Schedule: Every 15 minutes (or Real-time if needed)

Trigger Actions: Log to Triggered Alerts
(Or send to email, webhook, Slack — if you're feeling spicy 🌶️)
